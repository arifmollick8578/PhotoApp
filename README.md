# PhotoApp
Fetch data from "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/" and display on screen.

- This project is based on XML and Kotlin
- It has 2 screens basically 
#1: Display list of users with default avatar, name and address from (/users) API
#2: On click of any item, fetch photo from (/photos/{id}) and display with name and complete address.
- It seems very basic but I have followed all the best practices, code reusability
- Separed data layes into domain and presentation layer
- Used latest technologies like Kotlin, Hilt, Coroutine, Retrofit, MVVM, Clean architecture
